# WatchStocks
A simple Apple Watch OS 2 application that keeps track of your stocks portfolio &amp; displays amounts gained or lost in a day. The app also includes a complication that shows this data right on the watch face. 

##What works

- View a summary of your portfolio including: day's gain, total gain (%), total gain ($).
- View gains for individual stocks and their current market prices.

##To Do

- Add functionality to add transaction details through iPhone. Currently this needs to be done manually in the Parameters.swift file.
- Add detailed views
- Add charts
- Add support for more complication layouts
- Implement automatic complication update. Currently the complication is only updated if the user opens the app
