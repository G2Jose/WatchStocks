A simple Apple Watch OS 2 application that keeps track of your stocks portfolio &amp; displays amounts gained or lost in a day. The app also includes a complication that shows this data right on the watch face. 

##What works:

View gains for individual stocks and their current market prices.
##To Do:

Add functionality to add transaction details through iPhone. Currently this needs to be done manually in the Parameters.swift file.
